# Clean and analyze social media usage data with Python Project
## Introduction
This is a project for educational purposes. Do not use it for production. In this project, I take responsibilities of an entry level data analyst at a social media marketing company, tasked with analyzing the performance of various categories of social media posts. The main goal is to uncover meaningful insights that will help clients optimize their content strategies and boost engagement across their platforms.

The marketing agency specializes in promoting brands through targeted and data‑driven campaigns. To support these efforts, I’ve been asked to simulate and analyze post data across multiple categories such as Health, Family, Food, Fitness, and more. Using Python and key libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, I generated random social media post data, cleaned and explored the dataset, and created visualizations to better understand user interactions. This analysis is not only a great opportunity to practice data wrangling and visualization but also to demonstrate how data‑driven insights can inform smarter marketing decisions.

## Objectives
* Simulate and prepare data
* Generate a realistic dataset of social media posts across defined content categories (e.g., Health, Family, Food, Fitness) using Python’s data‑generation tools.
* Clean and validate data
* Remove duplicates and null entries, convert data types appropriately (dates to datetime, likes to integer), and ensure dataset integrity for analysis.
* Explore and visualize trends
* Use descriptive statistics and visualizations (histograms, boxplots) to identify distribution patterns and category‑based differences in engagement.
* Derive actionable insights
* Calculate overall and per‑category average likes, interpret findings to highlight top‑performing content types, and formulate data‑driven recommendations.
* Communicate results
* Prepare a clear, professional report of findings and recommendations to guide the agency’s social media strategy and help clients maximize reach and engagement. write a short summary of the objectives make it shorter
